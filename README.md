# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Python

## What is Handwritten Digit Recognition?

Handwritten digit recognition is the ability of a computer to recognize human digits. Itâ€™s a challenging task for the
machine because handwritten scores are imperfect and can be made with many different styles. Manual digit recognition is
a solution to this problem that uses the image of the digit and recognizes the digit in the image.

## Prerequisites

This interesting AI and ML project requires basic knowledge of Python, deep learning with the Keras library, and the
Tkinter library for building a GUI.

## The MNIST dataset

1. The MNIST dataset is a popular dataset used for image classification tasks in machine learning.
2. It consists of 70,000 black-and-white 28x28 images of handwritten characters extracted from two NIST databases.
3. The training data set contains 60,000 images and the validation data set contains 10,000 images, one class per digit
   so a total of 10 classes, with 7,000 images per class (6,000 train images and 1,000 test images) For benchmarking
   machine learning algorithms, learning-. For this purpose, the dataset is widely used.
